# Schedulr

## About

Schedulr is a web-based application that allows temporary staffing companies to post available shifts and allows users to claim those shifts. This is the backend repo for the app. The backend consists of Django with a SQL database. The decision to use SQL was made due to the nature of my models. They are very relational and I find SQL facilitates those relations easier than a Non-SQL database.

See the front-end repo [here](https://github.com/Schedulr-App/Schedulr) for more info.
